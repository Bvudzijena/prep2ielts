1. Responses 
Individual responses bring the conversation to a new level: genuine engagement. A high engagement and feedback will allow more interactions on the website.

1. Feedback
As responses come in, so should be our feedback. We should quickly give reilable and useable feedback to each individual, and sharing those responses to those who will have had highlighted they want to follow the topic on the day. Responses on other media, should be accompanied by a preview for that site, and a full statement on our website. Meaning we share the preview on the social media sites, and the actual full report or review on our website. This allows and keeps our website at the centre of the Flowchart, meaning everything assumed to happen on- and off-site will always be posted on the website.
